# Write-Heavy Workloads

- If you have a write-heavy workload, we strongly recommend a database that stores data in immutable files (e.g., Cassandra, ScyllaDB, and others that use LSM trees).2 These
databases optimize write speed because:
a) Writes are sequential, which is faster in terms of disk I/O
b) Writes are performed immediately, without first worrying about reading or updating existing values (like databases that rely on B-trees do).
** However, if you opt for a write-optimized database, be prepared for higher storage
requirements and the potential for slower reads.
